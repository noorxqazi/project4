# project4

This project looks into the social determinants of diabetes. Data is sourced from the CDC and Kaggle. Data are cleaned to focus only on Georgia counties, as well as to look at variables of interest: severe housing cost burden, no health insurance, and food insecurity. This work is shown in a Jupyter Notebook.

The presence of diabetes is examined in 253,680 people. 35,346 have the disease, while the rest do not. Having contracted diabetes is correlated with other risk factors, like heavy alcohol consumption, and a correlation table is shown in the Jupyter Notebook. A machine learning model using two hidden layers is developed. Fifty epochs are tested with an accuracy goal of 85%. This model is chosen for further examination of the data.

Tableau is also used to analyze the correlation between a lack of resources and diabetes diagnosis in Georgia counties specifically. The charts and visuals help us understand which resources have the biggest impact on the probability of a diabetes diagnosis.
